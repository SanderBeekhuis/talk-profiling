# Purpose
In this repo I maintain notes about a possible future talk on Performance profiling

# Setup
Assuming Python, Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install graphviz
pip install gprof2dot    
```


# Doing a profiling run
```
python -m profile main.py 
gprof2dot -f pstats main.pstats | dot -Tpng -o main.png
```



# Talk structure 
- Number of ways to speed up python code
    - Restrucure
    - Cache
    - Write in C or Cython
- But how to determine what part is slow
    - Easy in 10 line example
    - Hard in the real world
- Printing runtimes at crucial steps
    - In our case we didn't expect the actual block that was slowest
    - Create a test case! --> This will also help with the later profiling
        ยง Put it behind a flag to not always run it if it's slow (which it should be) 
- Basic Profiling
- Gprof2dot
    - Pruning options
- Competitor:  SnakeViz

# Asides
- Timit
- Memory profiling
